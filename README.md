Create Collection from File List
================================

Adobe Lightroom Plug-In
-----------------------

This is a simple plug-in that creates a new collection when given a simple list
of filenames. It will find all of the photos that match each basename
(i.e. filename without extension) in the that list. If multiple photos match
the basename, they are all added to the collection.
I wrote this plug-in to re-create collections from existing export folders.

Adobe Lightroom plug-ins are written in a subset of the [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) language.
